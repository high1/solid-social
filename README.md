# solid-social

## What?

Social components for [solid-js](https://www.solidjs.com/). This components are a port of [MDX Embed](https://www.mdx-embed.com/), but since their
usage is not tied with MDX, hence solid-social

## Installation

```sh
pnpm install --save-dev solid-social
```
## Usage

> Import what you need and use it. The API is practically the same as MDX Embed one.

```js
import { YouTube } from 'solid-social';

<YouTube youTubeId="OqcHoLWyyIw" />
```
